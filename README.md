## Description

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my professional work, skills and achievements. The main goal of a portfolio website is to demonstrate technical skills and expertise by showcasing various different projects. A portfolio website will allow me to stand out from other candidates when applying for jobs as potential employers will be able to see my experience, background and capabilities. A well organised and visually appealing portfolio will enhance my personal brand as it will showcase my individual style and personality. As I complete more projects I will be adding my favourite ones to this portfolio. I hope that this webpage will open up many opportunities for career and professional growth.
